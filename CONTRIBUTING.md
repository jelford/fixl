# Expectations

## What you can expect from me

This is free software that I develop in my spare time. I will do my best to keep it functional and useful, but
there is no SLA, and I can't promise to deliver timely responses to queries or issues.

Contributions will be gratefully received, and barrier to entry should be fairly low: if there's something
you would find useful and that's a natural fit for this extension, please go ahead and suggest it (or raise
a PR).

## What I expect from you

Not much. PRs are more helpful than bug reports, and if you need something then don't make it a chore.
That's it.

## How to contribute

Any way that's convenient to you:

* Raise an issue on GitHub's issue tracker
* Raise a pull request that adds things you want
* Email me directly to make a suggestion.

Whatever works.
